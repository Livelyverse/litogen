# Litogen
Litogen is an acronym for Lively Token Generator, which is a tool designed to generate ERC20 tokens with specific features. 
These features include the ability to be taxable, lockable, and have the option to pause both individual accounts and 
the entire contract. These functionalities have already been defined and implemented. Additionally, Litogen includes 
an Asset Manager, which facilitates the distribution of tokens to Ethereum externally owned accounts (EOAs) 
instead of traditional wallet addresses.
